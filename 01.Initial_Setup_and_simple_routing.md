# Fortinet Lab Series: Episode 1 - Initial Setup and OSPF Adventure

Hey there! Welcome to **Episode 1** of my Fortinet lab series. This is where we dive into setting up a FortiGate lab, starting from the basics and gradually exploring more complex configurations. If you're new to Fortinet or just looking to follow along, grab a seat and get comfy. Let’s get into it!

## Before We Begin...
Before this series, I had zero experience with FortiGate firewalls. I signed up for Fortinet’s [training platform](https://training.fortinet.com) and completed the FortiGate Operator and FCP 7.4 Administrator Self-Paced courses. Although the courses covered the essentials, they lacked the hands-on practice I was looking for. 

After some searching, I quickly realized buying FortiGate hardware was out of my budget, so virtualization became my best option. I chose VMware, which allowed me to set CPU and memory requirements more freely than GNS3, where the free FortiGate trial is limited to 1 CPU and 2 GB of memory. 

## Lab Setup Overview
The goal of this lab was to configure two virtual FortiGate firewalls on VMware, establish connectivity, enable DHCP, and configure OSPF. This would let a client on the internal network obtain an IP address and ping the internet.

### Step 1: FortiGate VM Setup
1. **Download the VM**: Fortinet provides virtual machine images on their [support page](https://support.fortinet.com/Download/Index.aspx). The ESXi image works well on VMware.

2. **License Limitations**:
   - 1 CPU and 2 GB of memory
   - Max of 3 interfaces, firewall policies, and routes
   - No FortiCare or FortiGuard support
   - Support for only low encryption operations, except GUI management

*P.S. Fortinet, if you’re reading, a more flexible evaluation license would make a world of difference for us lab enthusiasts!*

### Step 2: Initial Configuration
Boot up the VM and set up the initial network parameters through the CLI:

#### config system interface
```
edit port1
set mode static
set ip 192.168.100.10/24
end
```
#### Configure default gateway
```
config router static
edit 1 
set device port1
set gateway 192.168.100.1
end
```
#### Configure DNS
```
config system dns
set primary 208.91.112.53
set secondary 208.91.112.52
end
```
**Interface Config:** This sets port1 to a static IP on my management network (192.168.100.0/24).

**Default Gateway:** Sets the route towards my router’s IP.

**DNS Servers:** Configures DNS for external lookups.


With these settings, I could now ping my router and access the FortiGate login page on 192.168.100.11.

### Step 3: Interface and Network Segmentation
Port1: Connected to my home management network (192.168.100.0/24).

Port3: Assigned as my internal LAN (10.123.0.0/24).

![Interfaces](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Fortinet_Labs/blob/main/assets/screenshots/03.Interface3.PNG)

I plan to use Port2 later as my DMZ network. Setting up a dedicated management network keeps admin access separate from internal/external traffic for security.

### Step 4: Setting Up Firewall Policies
I created a firewall policy to allow traffic from the internal LAN (Port3) to reach the internet through the management network (Port1). The configuration allowed all sources, destinations, and services—more relaxed for now, as I just wanted to establish basic connectivity.

### Step 5: NAT Configuration
To translate internal IPs for internet access, I enabled NAT in the firewall settings:

Central SNAT: Enabled under System Settings, allowing centralized NAT management.

### Step 6: Static Route Setup
I added a static route pointing towards my router’s IP. This is necessary so the firewall knows how to reach external networks.

![Static Route](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Fortinet_Labs/blob/main/assets/screenshots/14.Static_Route.png)

### Step 7: Testing Connectivity
Once the static route and NAT were configured, I tested connectivity by pinging the internet from the CLI on the firewall—success!

# OSPF and DHCP Configuration
With basic connectivity set, I decided to take it further by configuring OSPF between two firewalls and enabling DHCP.

### Step 8: Adding a Second Firewall
I spun up a second FortiGate VM and configured it similarly to the first, with a unique management IP.

Firewall Policy: Allowed devices on FW2 to route traffic through FW1.

![FW2_Policy](https://github.com/RouteSeeker/Fortinet_Labs/blob/main/assets/screenshots/17.FW2_Policy.png)

DHCP Setup: Enabled DHCP on FW2’s internal network (10.2.0.0/24), with an IP range configured for clients.

### Step 9: Configuring OSPF
Next, I enabled OSPF on both firewalls to allow network sharing. This setup lets both FW1 and FW2 recognize each other’s networks.

### Final Test
I connected a Linux client to the 10.2.0.0/24 network, and it successfully obtained an IP from DHCP. A quick ping to fortinet.com confirmed internet connectivity and that DNS was working correctly.

### What’s Next?
This lab setup was a blast and a great learning experience. I’m planning to keep exploring what Fortinet has to offer, especially with advanced configurations. One day, I’d love to get my hands on a physical FortiGate firewall to unlock even more possibilities.

Stay tuned for the next lab, and thanks for following along with Episode 1!
